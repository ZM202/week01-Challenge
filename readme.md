## Week #1 - 
Login Authentication
3.18.20

## Challenge Description

It ran to some extend but even though there is supposed to be an alert popping up, it isn't doing it.

## Explain your solution

I used what we learned in class. If userName is equal to this let this message pop up. As well as alert for if
the particular string was generated, what the alert message should be.

## What are you thoughts about this challenge? Did you like it?

It looks easy but when I started to do it, I ended up breaking up the instruction and regrouping it in certain ways.
The code should have worked but I can't figure it out why the alert wouldn't populated based on what I generated in js.

## What have you learned from it?

I learned that I'm behind than I realzied w/javascript. I ended up going back to some slides we got just to referesh my
memory on what we learned so far.
